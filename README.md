# RockPaperScissorsLizardSpockApi
 Test Primitive API for RockPaperScissorsLizardSpock game

## Running the sample using Docker locally

Run these commands from the root folder (where the .sln file is located):

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

You should be able to make requests to [localhost:5201](http://localhost:5201) for the API project via http, and [localhost:5202](https://localhost:5202) via https once these commands complete.
You can also run the application by using the instructions located in its `Dockerfile` file in the root of the project. Again, run these commands from the root of the solution (where the .sln file is located).
